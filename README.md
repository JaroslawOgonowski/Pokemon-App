# Open no redux project

Project goal was, of course, to enhance my programming skills encompassing the realm of frontend development. Throughout the project, I harnessed a toolkit that included React, Styled-Components, TypeScript, TanStack Query, Color Thief, and React Router DOM. A conscious decision was made to fully explore the capabilities of TanStack Query, thereby forgoing the use of Redux or Sagas. Instead, I opted to manage individual states directly within the components. The results were nothing short of astonishing - TanStack Query emerged as a seamlessly integrated companion to React, elevating data fetching and management to new heights.

By embracing this approach, I empowered components to wield their own data management responsibilities, leading to a streamlined and highly efficient architecture. The strategic synergy of React and TanStack Query transformed mundane data fetching into a dynamic and fluid experience. With queries and mutations seamlessly integrated into components, the entire ecosystem became more responsive, ensuring that data flows harmoniously between the server and the user interface.

Furthermore, the decision to bypass the conventional Redux path in favor of a TanStack Query-powered paradigm showcased a commitment to innovation and modern development paradigms. This approach underscores a dedication to staying on the cutting edge of industry trends, all while leveraging the full power of the React ecosystem.

Incorporating TanStack Query has opened a gateway to a future where frontend development embraces not just the present, but also the promise of tomorrow. The project's journey, bolstered by the capabilities of TanStack Query, serves as a testament to the ability of modern tooling to elevate the art of frontend development to new dimensions. As a developer, this exploration not only deepened my technical prowess but also expanded my horizons, transforming me into a purveyor of efficient and forward-looking frontend experiences.

## Style
The visual layer itself proved to be quite a substantial challenge - while implementing the concept using Styled Components was relatively straightforward, devising and maintaining a consistent design across all layers posed a considerably greater difficulty. Given that this is my original project, a significant amount of time was dedicated to conceptualizing the visual aspects and ensuring their cohesiveness.

The journey of visual realization brought to light the intricate dance between creativity and technical execution. Translating an idea into a tangible, harmonious design extended beyond the realms of code, requiring a delicate balance of aesthetics, usability, and innovation. In this pursuit, every pixel and interaction carried the weight of intent, and each decision played a role in weaving a tapestry of user experience.

The process of crafting a unified design language, one that seamlessly spans from the user interface to the underlying architecture, was akin to orchestrating a symphony. Striking the right chords across diverse components, layouts, and interactions was an art that demanded meticulous attention to detail and an unwavering commitment to achieving visual resonance.

This journey, marked by the pursuit of design coherence, encapsulated the essence of craftsmanship in the digital realm. It served as a reminder that while technology empowers us with tools, it's the creative vision and dedication to aesthetic excellence that breathe life into a project. As the custodian of this endeavor, I not only refined my ability to translate ideas into visuals but also embraced the artistry that elevates a digital creation into an immersive and captivating experience.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
